  o Minor features (security, TLS):
    - When we are running with OpenSSL 3.5.0 or later,
      support using the ML-KEM768 for post-quantum key agreement.
      Closes ticket 41041.

  o Minor features (performance TLS):
    - When running with with OpenSSL 3.0.0 or later,
      support using X25519 for TLS key agreement.
      (This should slightly improve performance
      for TLS session establishment.)
